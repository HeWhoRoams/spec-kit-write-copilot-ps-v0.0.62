# Scenes & Writing Tasks: [NARRATIVE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/narratives/[###-narrative-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: narrative-outline.md (required), narrative-spec.md (required for character arcs), research-notes.md, character-model.md

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by character arc to enable independent drafting and editing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Arc] Description`
- **[P]**: Can be written in parallel (different scenes, no dependencies)
- **[Arc]**: Which character arc this task belongs to (e.g., CA1, CA2, CA3)
- Include exact scene or chapter paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared World-Building)

**Purpose**: Initial world-building and character groundwork

- [ ] S001 Draft initial character descriptions for all major characters
- [ ] S002 [P] Outline a timeline of major historical events
- [ ] S003 [P] Write a short description of the primary setting
- [ ] S004 Write the first chapter's opening sentence, establishing the tone

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core narrative elements that MUST be complete before ANY character arc can be developed

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No character arc work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] S005 Draft the inciting incident scene
- [ ] S006 [P] Write the protagonist's core motivation
- [ ] S007 [P] Establish the core conflict
- [ ] S008 Draft a scene showcasing the main character's fatal flaw

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - character arc writing can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: Character Arc 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Writing Tasks for Character Arc 1

- [ ] S009 [P] [CA1] Draft scene in Chapter 1 where [Character] first encounters [Conflict]
- [ ] S010 [P] [CA1] Write dialogue for the [scene] in Chapter 3
- [ ] S011 [CA1] Draft the climax scene in src/part_1_rising_action/chapter_10.md
- [ ] S012 [CA1] Rewrite the ending to establish the new status quo

**Checkpoint**: At this point, Character Arc 1 should be fully drafted and ready for review

---

## Phase 4: Character Arc 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Writing Tasks for Character Arc 2

- [ ] S013 [P] [CA2] Draft scene in Chapter 5 where [Character] joins the plot
- [ ] S014 [P] [CA2] Write inner monologue for [Character] at a key turning point
- [ ] S015 [CA2] Draft a scene showing the character's internal conflict
- [ ] S016 [CA2] Integrate with Character Arc 1 scenes

**Checkpoint**: At this point, Character Arcs 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---
## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Final revisions that affect multiple arcs

- [ ] SXXX [P] Proofread the entire manuscript for typos and grammatical errors
- [ ] SXXX Rewrite dialogue to improve voice consistency
- [ ] SXXX [P] Check for thematic consistency across all chapters
- [ ] SXXX Refine pacing of key scenes
---
## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all character arcs
- **Character Arcs (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - Character arcs can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired character arcs being complete

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- Once Foundational phase completes, all character arcs can start in parallel
- All writing tasks for a character arc marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different character arcs can be worked on in parallel by different team members
