[PROJECT_NAME] Narrative Constitution

Version: [VERSION] | Ratified: [DATE]

Core Principles
I. Outline-First (Non-Negotiable)

Every section, scene, or chapter begins as an intent declaration:

Purpose, target tone, audience, and reference base must be defined before prose begins.

AI and author iterate on outline until objectives are clear.

No narrative is written “freeform” until its structure has been tested for coherence.

II. Modular Storycraft

Each story component (character, setting, argument, historical citation, or theme) functions as an independent narrative module:

Must be self-contained and well-documented (e.g., reference files, notes).

Each module should declare dependencies (e.g., character arcs depend on setting continuity).

Modules can be swapped, merged, or versioned independently in VS Code or Git.

III. Voice and Tone Consistency

Every project defines a Voice Manifest at inception:

Style parameters (e.g., formal vs. literary, omniscient vs. close POV).

AI prompt instructions must reference the manifest to preserve tone.

Deviations from the voice must be intentional and documented as “Tone Experiments.”

IV. Source Integrity

All factual or historical statements must trace to verifiable sources:

AI-generated content requires a source justification (link, title, or primary record).

Citations stored in a separate /sources directory; linked to the manuscript through metadata.

Unsupported or speculative material must be flagged as “Conjecture.”

V. Iterative Refinement and Review

Every draft undergoes multiple review stages:

Phase 1: Outline Approval

Phase 2: Scene/Chapter Draft

Phase 3: Editorial Merge Request (content comparison + feedback)

Phase 4: Tone & Continuity Audit

Merges require both stylistic approval and thematic integrity verification.

VI. Thematic and Ethical Coherence

Every project declares a Moral Compass — its stance on truth, justice, human dignity, or freedom.

No narrative may violate this compass.

For historical or political works, balance critique with empathy and truth.

For speculative works, ethical implications must be explored, not ignored.

VII. AI Collaboration Protocol

All AI interactions occur through structured prompts with clear roles:

AI = Researcher, Drafter, Editor, or Critic

Human = Author, Curator, or Approver

Every exchange (prompt + output) logged for version control.

The final manuscript is a co-authored work, but human intent always prevails.
